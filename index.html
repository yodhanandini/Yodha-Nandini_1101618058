                 <p>On September 21st, NCT 2020 dropped a teaser video called ‘Interlude: Resonance’ on their official YouTube channel. Just a few hours later, they posted a timeline for their forthcoming 1st album, ‘NCT 2020: Resonance Pt. 1’. The teaser video showcases clips of all the previous MVs of title tracks performed by the various NCT sub-units. They include NCT 127, NCT U, NCT Dream and WayV. We also hear an electronic instrumental backing the packed montage. At the end of the teaser we see the group’s new logo which consists of four sliver rings that form the number ‘2020’. The last time all members of the group were in one release was back in 2018 with their full album, NCT 2018 Empathy. </p>

                 <div class="col">
                <p> Since then more idols have been added into the lineup which then only contained 18 members. SM Entertainment also announced two new members, Shotaro and Sungchan to be put into the group, making for a total of 23 members in the album. Through their rotational unit NCT U, they will showcase their talents and abilities within a range of diverse concepts. As seen with the timeline, the upcoming album will feature double title tracks, ‘Make A Wish’ and ‘Home’. The naming of the album being labelled as Part 1, hints there will be a Part 2 sometime in the future.</p>

The song is unlike any other NCT U song but at the same time follows the NCT pattern: experimental hip hop beat extremely catchy. The song has been described as a dance-pop track with a hip hop beat and an addicting whistling sound, and this is a sentence that you can hear clearly in the track and all the elements are well balanced together.</p>
